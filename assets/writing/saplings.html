            Two saplings stood close, leaves reaching the sky,  
            Dancing in the wind, just you and I.  
            Through climbs and falls, together they flew,  
            With each cheer and heckle, their bond only impro-  
            ved. Constant yapping and questions, though sometimes annoy
            (krystian mostly annoyed krystian), 

            But seasons change, and space starts to grow,  
            Now off to California, where new adventures flow.  
            To chase dreams and knowledge, to learn and hold toes,  
            Above ground, they part, as winds start to blow.  
            From afar they seem distant, no longer entwined,  
            Yet beneath the soil, their roots are connected  
            A hidden embrace, their bond unaffected.

            You've been a bright light, so giving and true,  
            Confident and radiant in all that you do.  
            I wish you love and joy in your new home,  
            Where you'll find new trees and saplings to roam.

            Though miles may part us, from shore unto shore,  
            Our friendship’s a blossom, its roots evermore.
