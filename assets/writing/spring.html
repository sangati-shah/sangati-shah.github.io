        I wonder if you stay still enough,
        can you hear the flower buds forming,
        the first dandelions sprouting from
        wet soil pulsing with gentle courageous footsteps.

        If you pause for a moment,
        can you pick up the sounds that were buried <span class="indent">under blankets of snow</span>
        coos from mourning doves and tuks from robins.
        The first creaks of a swinging door
        as you step onto a squishy Earth.

        Listen
        to the rhythmic dance of each new blade of grass <span class="indent">as the wind surfs through it</span>
        and the
        release of a breath
        taught tight with tension
        released as you sway along too. </pre>
