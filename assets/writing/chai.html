            When your roommate makes you a morning cup of chai, 
            and that simple gesture is all the proof you need that she loves you.

            You grew up in an immigrant's home where love wasn’t spoken but served— 
            fruit cut silently and placed while you study late, 
            mom making what she thinks your favorite dessert is when you fight. 
            
            Those three words were never said out loud, 
            only shown through walnuts and dates. 
            
            So when she hands you that chai, it feels like home. 
            And then she actually says it—and somehow, 
            that quiet love you grew up with finds a voice, 
            
            and it’s even sweeter than any cup of chai.
