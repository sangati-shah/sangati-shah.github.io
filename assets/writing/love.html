          One look at you and its all I can feel.
          It is the easiest thing I have ever done.
          I love you when we are squished together,
          like the sun squishes onto a tree,
          two halves of the same whole.

          I love you more when we are far apart,
          when I only get a few days in a month, and
          even if it was only a few months in a year.
          Each day I fall more in love with you.
          
          Like an moss growing over every pothole, 
          my love for you knows no bounds.  
          
          Pure unconditional love,
          that's all I feel. 
          It is not hard to love you my love
          It is all I can do.
