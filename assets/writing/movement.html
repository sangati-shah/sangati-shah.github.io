        <article> 
            <p> I’ve always been someone who moves quickly. 
            I decide quickly, act quickly, and recover quickly. 
            When something needs fixing, my first instinct is to do — to rearrange, to solve, to move on. 
            For a long time I wore that impulse as a badge of honor. 
            </p> 
            <h2>The Urge to Keep Going</h2> 
            <p> Recently, a close friend pointed out something I had been skirting around: 
                my movement is sometimes a reflex, not a choice. 
                There are moments when my busyness is less about forward momentum and more about simply avoiding stillness. 
                If I’m busy, I don’t have to sit with the unease under the surface. 
                If I’m reorganizing the same thing again and again, 
                I can call it productivity instead of admitting it’s restlessness. 
            </p> 
            <blockquote> 
                <strong>Movement as a reflex</strong>—an instinctive response to anxiety, a habit that substitutes for the slower, harder work of reflection. 
            </blockquote> 
            <h2>When Time Feels Like an Enemy</h2> 
            <p> Much of my life I’ve treated time like something to outrun. 
                Pauses feel like lost opportunities. 
                The quieter the moment, the louder the pressure: if I’m not doing, 
                I must be wasting time. That sense of urgency motivates action, 
                but it can also make my choices reactive rather than deliberate. 
            </p> 
            <p> The consequence is that motion can become circular: I move rapidly but without direction, mistaking speed for progress. 
                It’s an exhausting pattern, and it hides the simple truth that stillness — thoughtfully chosen — 
                often produces better results than perpetual motion. 
            </p> 
            <h2>Redefining Progress</h2> 
            <p> I’m trying to reframe what progress means. 
                Progress doesn’t have to be loud or fast. 
                It can be considered and quiet. 
                It can come from pausing long enough to know whether the next move is actually the right one. 
                My friend encouraged me to practice patience intentionally — not as passivity, but as preparedness. 
            </p> 
            <p> Practically, that has meant small experiments: meditating for a few minutes each morning, 
                keeping a short journal to notice recurring impulses, and deliberately sitting without multitasking.
                The first attempts feel awkward. The habits conflict with a lifetime of reflexive doing. 
                Still, those small pauses uncover clearer priorities and steadier decisions. 
            </p> 
            <h2>Learning to Pause</h2> 
            <p> Reflexes can be retrained. We teach our bodies to breathe before reacting under pressure; 
                we can teach ourselves to pause before moving when the movement is driven by fear rather than intention. 
                Time can be an ally when we allow it to be. 
            </p> 
            <p> The next time I feel the impulse to fix something immediately, 
                I want to recognize it for what it is: a reflex. 
                Then I want to ask a simple question — “Why now?” — and give myself the space to hear the answer. 
                That small step changes the nature of the action that follows. 
            </p>

                <p>If this resonates with you, try it as an experiment: notice one reflexive urge today, 
                    pause for thirty seconds, and ask whether what follows comes from intention or from avoidance. 
                    It’s surprising what clarity a short pause can bring.
