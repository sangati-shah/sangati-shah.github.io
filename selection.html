        <h3>selection process</h3>
        <p>Because the abduction process comes without any warning and can be quite jarring, we've found it important to help people understand how their loved ones were chosen to join us in space.
            We're hoping this page will illuminate just how thorough the process we undertake is.
            It is truely one of the greatest honors to be able to be chosen as a candidate.</p>

                <h4>Get Noticed</h4>
                <p>The first step in the selection process is simple, the candidate simply has to get noticed. 
                    This can be either by submitting an application or by being noticed by one of our recruiters.
                </p>

                <h4>shadow</h4>
                <p>after a candidate is identified, we have a team of professional shadows follow their every move for the next year. 
                    This is to ensure that the candidate will be a good fit for the abduction program.

                <h4>commitee vote</h4>
                <p>after following the candidate for a year, the evidence gathered is presented in front of a commitee of experts.
                    they assess the candidate and make a decision on the candidate.
