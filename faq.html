            <h4>What is happening?</h4>
            <p>Your loved one has been given the opportunity to live amongst and serve gods, 
            there is truely no greater honor in this exsistence.</p>
            
            <h4>Why my loved one, though?</h4>
            <p>Your loved one either submitted an aplication or was spotted by one of our scouts.
                They must have shown great character to have reached this point. While we are incapable of empathizing, I have been told that this is hard for you humans.
                Find solace in knowing that your loved ones were deemed worthy.</p>
            <h4>Will I ever see them again?</h4>
            <p>No.</p>

            <h4>What will they be doing?</h4>
            <p>This is confidential information. 
                All we can say is that there is a rigorous initiation and assimilation process and only about 0.01% of candidates are able to survive this process. 
                After that they will begin contributing to our society. 
                When their body gives out, we can deliver the husk to you if you so desire.</p>

            <h4>Husk?</h4>
            <p>Husk.</p>
