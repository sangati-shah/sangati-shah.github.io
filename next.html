        <p>the process only just begins when someone is picked up off earth.
            in order to be a useful member in our society, we have many requirements that we need the humans to meet. 
            of course there are times when the candidate is unable to meet the requirements despite the thoroughness of our investigation, but this is something we are working to improve in our process.
