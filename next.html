        <h3>what comes after being abducted?</h3>
        <p>the process only just begins when someone is picked up off earth.
            in order to be a useful member in our society, we have many requirements that we need the humans to meet. 
            of course there are times when the candidate is unable to meet the requirements despite the thoroughness of our investigation, but this is something we are working to improve in our process.
        </p>

                <p>being in space can be extremely difficult so we do everything to make the transition seamless. 
                we make sure that the new recruits know the rules of living amongst aliens.</p>

                <p>after learning the rules, the recruitees need to be assimilated into society.
                    they will take cultural and language immersion programs in order to learn how to live as a superior being.</p>

                <p>After the candidate is judged to be properly assimilated, the candidate will contribute to society. 
                Ultimately their role is to help us strive towards universal supremacy.</p>
